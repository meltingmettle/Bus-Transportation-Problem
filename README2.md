To run files:

1. In terminal, run "python3 algorithm1_and_2.py". (this algorithm will take thelongest time to run)
  The outputs will show up in a folder called "alg_1_and_2_outputs". 
  Make sure a parent folder called all_inputs is in your current directory, wherever you are storing these python code files.
2. Run

         python3 algorithm3.py
  Outputs will be in folder "lg_3_outputs"
3. Compare the outputs using output_comparer.py. Run

         python3 output_comparer.py alg_1_and_2_outputs alg_3_outputs
    
    Output will go to folder outputs_combined.
