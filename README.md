# Additional Notes for Future Reference
In retrospect, it would have been wise to create class representations of each variable/parameter.  The excitement of an algorithm project may have spurred us to overlook code consistency and our understanding of OOP.  Our team emphasized brainstorming the pros and cons of different approaches and we lept into implementation after choosing our five best approaches.  This ended up costing time later, when we began combining code and connecting the various handlers.  In addition, actually implementing class representations of each attribute would have been doable within the first day of reading the project since it only requires a basic understanding of the prompt and it could have even inspired us with new ideas.

Well, all's well that ends well.

# Thank Yous
Thanks to Professor Rao, Professor Chiesa, and Sam Zhou, our TA who provided guidance and invaluable mentoring throughout the course as well as through the entire project.  Your passion for algorithms shone through your teaching and inspired us through the semester!

Additional thanks to my long-time friends and partners Maryam and Aidan. 
I really appreciate your hard work, dedication to excellence, calm under pressure, teamwork, and great personality which made you both a pleasure to work with! I hope we have the chance to collaborate more in the future!
